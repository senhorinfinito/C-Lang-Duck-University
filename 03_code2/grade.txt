              ^
temp.c:38:14: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
temp.c:38:20: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘Triangle’
   numStars = print Triangle(7);
                    ^
temp.c:40:10: error: format ‘%d’ expects a matching ‘int’ argument [-Werror=format=]
